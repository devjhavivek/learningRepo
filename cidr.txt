Classless Inter Domain Routing

CIDR values represent IP addressing in VPC. The IP range created with IP 
address and subnet mask.

It specifically consists of 8 0's and 8 1's binary values. The subnet mask 
will decide the range of IP address allocated in a particular network. 
example IP address with subnet mask is 10.0.0.1/24. Subnet mask will decide
how many spaces should be locked within network.
